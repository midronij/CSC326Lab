To run backend code using test cases:

Method 1:
1.) Open terminal/command line
2.) Navigate to directory containing source code
3.) Use the following command to run both test sites and crawler: "python crawler.py & python test.py & python test2.py"

Method 2 (only use this if method 1 does not work!):
1.) Open a terminal window
2.) Navigate to the source code directory and run the first test site with: "python test.py"
3.) Open another terminal window. DO NOT close the first one.
4.) Navigate to the souce code directory and run the second test site with "python test2.py"
5.) Open another terminal window. DO NOT close the other ones.
6.) Navigate to the source code directory and run crawler with "python crawler.py"

To run the frontend code, simple navigate to the source code directory and use "python Webpage.py"
